        <p>Once upon a time, there was a chicken. There wasn't anything particularly special about that chicken. It was just 
            going about its normal chicken days in its normal chicken life, for the most part <span class="animate__animated animate__rotateIn">chicked</span> out of everything. Nothing <span class="animate__animated animate__rotateIn">eggsited</span>
            the chicken.
        </p>
        <p>
            But enough was <span class="animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">un oeuf</span>. One day the chicken <span class="animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">yolk</span>up and the chicken chose to make a change. That's it. <span class="animate__animated animate__flipInX">(Over)easy</span>as that. No big plans,
            no big investments. Just one decision and the courage to jump and <span class="animate__animated animate__fadeInTopLeft">wing</span>wing it. So. 
        </p>
