          Once upon a time, there was a chicken. There wasn't anything
          particularly special about that chicken. It was just going about its
          normal chicken days in its normal chicken life, for the most part
          <span class="animate__animated animate__rotateIn">chicked</span> out

          courage to jump and
          <span class="animate__animated animate__fadeInTopLeft">wing</span> it.
          So...
