        <p>It is not by mere coincidence that two of the greatest questions of mankind
            pertain to the majestic <span>Gallus gallus</span>, family <span>Phasianidae</span>, order <span>Galliformes</span>. 
            Indeed, which came first, the chicken or the egg? And why, <em>why</em> did the
            chicken cross the road?
        </p>
        <p>Perhaps it is not our prerogative to know. Perhaps instead, we should wonder why it is that the chicken came to be at
            such a forefront of human marvel, and what we can do to further foster that senser of wonder within ourselves.

          Wise chicken advice: face your fears. Stare them down. If you're in a burning building, stay right there.
          Take a deep breath. Stand your ground.
